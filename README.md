This project is paired with [this repo](https://github.com/phantom-98/socket.io-server) and requires `.env` file which has two env variables:
```
VITE_SOCKETIO_SERVER=       // your socket io server url
VITE_PEERJS_SERVER=         // your peerjs server. it can be "0.peerjs.com"
```

## Tech stack

* React + Vite
* Socket.io
* PeerJS
* Voice Activity Detection

## Deployment on Vercel

This project is live on [https://simple-meet.vercel.app](https://simple-meet.vercel.app)

Since it is impossible to deploy socket.io server with free service, I used a live socket.io server from one of my past project.
